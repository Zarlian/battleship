# Battleship Game Web Application

## Description
One of the most exciting projects I worked on during my first year was bringing the classic board game "Battleship" to life as a fully functional website. This was a collaborative group effort, where we developed the backend using Java and crafted the frontend with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game featured several modes, including the traditional version, a Salvo mode, and an innovative move-and-shoot mode, which allowed players to reposition their ships or fire each turn.

## Features
- **Multiple Game Modes**: 
  - Traditional Battleship mode
  - Salvo mode, allowing multiple shots based on remaining ships
  - Move-and-shoot mode for repositioning ships and firing each turn

- **Engaging User Experience**: 
  - Intuitive and customizable frontend
  - Themes, sound effects, and animations enhance gameplay

- **Real-Time Tracking**: 
  - Players can track their shots on the enemy board
  - Clear indications of hits and misses
  - Side panels provide real-time updates on the status of each player's ships

- **Game End Screens**: 
  - Victory or defeat screens with options to play again or exit

## Backend
The backend of the application was developed using Java. An OpenAPI YAML file outlined the structure of the API responses we needed to handle, which were sometimes intentionally designed to challenge our skills. This project introduced us to critical concepts such as separating logic from the web layer, ensuring a clean architectureâ€”a principle known as "separation of concerns." We successfully combined the frontend and backend, resulting in a cohesive and fully functional application.

## Frontend
The frontend was crafted using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We focused on making it intuitive and engaging, allowing players to easily navigate the game. The design facilitated easy access to join or create games, enhancing the overall user experience. 

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **API Development**: OpenAPI
- **Game Modes**: Custom logic for traditional, Salvo, and move-and-shoot modes

## Conclusion

In the end, we were thrilled with the results of our efforts. What initially seemed like an intimidating task transformed into a rewarding experience, as we not only completed the project but also exceeded our own expectations. This accomplishment was a proud moment for our team, knowing that we had successfully tackled such a large-scale project. It marked a significant milestone in our learning journey, reinforcing our confidence and skills. As we celebrated our achievement, we felt invigorated and eager to take on even more ambitious challenges in the future, motivated by the knowledge that we could turn complex ideas into reality through collaboration and innovation.
